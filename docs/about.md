# About

discord-features-handler began as a personal project to create my first npm package. At the time, I was developing three Discord.js bots for different servers using the same format for loading commands, events, and module files for the bots.

By making this package, I hope I can help bot developers create their own Discord.js bots without the hassle of defining a handler to load each file and just focus on building the command and event files for the bot.

## Roadmap and future development

Future development of this package will reflect major version updates for Discord.js as well as any bug fixes for this package. You can check the progress in the dev branch; however, there may be undocumented changes and features.

??? note "Development Branch"
    ```js
      npm install github:bng94/discord-features-handler#dev
    ```
